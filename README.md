# Audio Amplifier and Zero Beat Indicator for QRP Transceivers
This projects contains the necessary files and assembly instructions for a small PCB that includes a
a) LM386-based audio amplifier and a
b) LMC567-based zero beat indicator.

The board was designed for the [Mountain Topper SOTA GoBox](https://github.com/mfhepp/gobox) project, but can be used for any other similar project.

The LM386 amplifier is carefully tuned to operate in RF-noisy environments, as typical for amateur radio transceivers. For that purpose, it includes several additional filter components not found in the mainstream datasheet applications.

Design decisions will also be included in the final version.

**Note:** This is work-in-progress. I will remove this message when the materials are ready for use.

## Sources
The files in the repository contain 
* Gerber and drill files for producing your own PCBs, and
* a KiCad project with the schematics, PCB, and parts and footprints libraries.

KiCad is a great and free electronics design package. For more information, see [http://kicad-pcb.org/](http://kicad-pcb.org/).
